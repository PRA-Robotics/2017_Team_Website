                <p class='sectionTextA'>The most anticipated and dreaded day of the season is the day of a tournament. This is the day when all of the effort a team has poured into their robot is either proves to be succesful, or all for nothing. Some teams (us included) tend to stay up late the night before franticly working to iron out any problems they can find. Then, when the day comes, every member of every team enters the tournament with mixed feelings of excitement and panic. The time between the start and finish of the tournament is filled with joy, dissappointment, drama, comradery, fierce competitiveness, and gracious professionalism. By the end, everyone including judges, teams, coaches, and parents are relieved that it is all over.</p>

                    <p class='sectionHeaderB'>Tournament Overview</p>
                    <p class='sectionTextB'>Depending on the tier of the competition, a tournament can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Regardless of length, most tournaments follow a similar process. The beginning of the tournament involves robot inspection by judges and team interviews. After inspections and interviews, the tournament completes the qualifying rounds. After the qualifying rounds, semi-finalist alliances are organized and compete in the elemination rounds. At the end of the elimination rounds, one alliance is declared the winner and the tournament closes by issuing awards to teams. Then based on who won the tournament and who won awards, the teams who are to progress to the next tier of competition are announced, and the tournament ends.</p>

                <p class='sectionHeaderA'>Judge Interviews</p>
                <p class='sectionTextA'>Although the challenge itself is the focus of a tournament, judges distribute awards for elements such as design, the engineering notebook, and how well a team embodies gracious professionalism. In order to get a real feel for the team outside of the challenge, judges interview the teams and allow them to explain their process of building the robot, what community outreach they have done, and how they set themselves apart from other teams. The judges then collect the engineering notebooks for examination and the teams are free to return to the pits.</p>

                    <p class='sectionTextB'>The teams need somewhere to work on the robot between before and between matches. For this purpose, pits are setup behind the playing fields. As teams arrive, they are assigned to some form of table or workspace within which they can keep their tools and belongings and work on the robot. Once the pits are set up, robot inspections begin and robots are certified for the competition. A hardware inspection ensures that the robot starts within an 18"x18"x18" cube and poses no danger to drive teams, referees, or the audience. Once the hardware has been deemed safe and legal, the robot undergoes a software inspection. The software is tested to ensure that the robot is operational and safe. Once certified, the robot is allowed to compete in matches.</p>

                <p class='sectionHeaderA'>Qualifying Rounds</p>
                <p class='sectionTextA'>Once interviews and inspections are completed, schedules are randomly generated for the qualifying rounds. In lower tier tournamanets such as qualifiers or regional championships, teams usually play four or five matches by the end of this period. In higher tier tournaments such as Super-Regional Championships or the World Championship, teams may play as many as nine or ten matches. The teams in the winning alliance of each match are awarded two qualifying points (QP), and in the case of a tie, all teams are awarded one qualifying point. Then both teams are awarded ranking points (RP) equal to the losing alliance's score. The teams are then ranked by QP first, then RP in the case of a tie of QP.</p>

                    <p class='sectionTextB'>The qualifying rounds are followed by semi-finalist alliance selection. A representative from each team approaches the playing fields. Then four highest ranked teams become alliance captains and send a representative to stand in front of the pool of other team representatives. Then, beginning with the highest seeded team, alliance team selections are made. In the first round of picks, the captains may request that another captain join their alliance, or request that a team from the pool join their alliance. Then, in the second round of picks, the captains select a second alliance member from the pool of remaining alliances. Finally, alliances are seeded by rank of their alliance captain. Any teams not selected do not advance beyond the qualifying rounds.</p>

                <p class='sectionHeaderA'>Elimination Tournament</p>
                <p class='sectionTextA'>Once the alliances have been organized and seeded, the elimination tournament begins. Just as in most tournaments, Alliance One plays Alliance Four and Alliance Two plays Alliance Three. Elimination rounds are different from qualifying rounds in that they are best two-of-three rather than single matches. The alliance that wins two of the three matches moves on to the finals. Then, the two winning semi-finalist alliances become finalist alliance and play in the final round. The same rules apply in the final round as in the semi-final rounds. The winner of the finals becomes the winning alliance and is the champion of the tournament.</p>

                    <p class='sectionTextB'>At the conclusion of the elimination rounds, an award ceremony takes place. This ceremony includes recognizing the winning alliance and presenting their awards, as well as the presentation of other awards. The awards include awards for design, the engineering notebook, innovative software, and the coveted Inspire Award. A list of the available awards can be found to the right. Once the winner and the finalists for each award are recognized, the teams that will be advancing to the next tier of competition are announced.</p>

The top 15 awards in the order of teams advanced are listed to the left. If a team wins multiple awards in multiple tournaments in the same region, they can only advance to the next tournament once. If the order would have a team that has already advanced advance again, it skips to the next award down the list. The number of teams that may be advanced differs bewteen tournaments. For example, Colorado FTC may only end five teams to a super-regional competition while Pennsylvania FTC may send eight. After the advancing teams are announced, the tournament concludes.</p>
