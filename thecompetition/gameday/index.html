                <p class='sectionTextA'>The most anticipated and dreaded day of the season is the day of a tournament. This is the day when all of the effort a team has poured into their robot is either proves to be succesful, or all for nothing. Some teams (us included) tend to stay up late the night before franticly working to iron out any problems they can find. Then, when the day comes, every member of every team enters the tournament with mixed feelings of excitement and panic. The time between the start and finish of the tournament is filled with joy, dissappointment, drama, comradery, fierce competitiveness, and gracious professionalism. By the end, everyone including judges, teams, coaches, and parents are relieved that it is all over.</p>

                    <p class='sectionHeaderB'>Tournament Overview</p>
                    <p class='sectionTextB'>Depending on the tier of the competition, a tournament can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Regardless of length, most tournaments follow a similar process. The beginning of the tournament involves robot inspection by judges and team interviews. After inspections and interviews, the tournament completes the qualifying rounds. After the qualifying rounds, semi-finalist alliances are organized and compete in the elemination rounds. At the end of the elimination rounds, one alliance is declared the winner and the tournament closes by issuing awards to teams. Then based on who won the tournament and who won awards, the teams who are to progress to the next tier of competition are announced, and the tournament ends.</p>

                <p class='sectionHeaderA'>Judge Interviews</p>
                <p class='sectionTextA'>Although the challenge itself is the focus of a tournament, judges distribute awards for elements such as design, the engineering notebook, and how well a team embodies gracious professionalism. In order to get a real feel for the team outside of the challenge, judges interview the teams and allow them to explain their process of building the robot, what community outreach they have done, and how they set themselves apart from other teams. The judges then collect the engineering notebooks for examination and the teams are free to return to the pits.</p>

                    <p class='sectionTextB'>The teams need somewhere to work on the robot between before and between matches. For this purpose, pits are setup behind the competition fields. As teams arrive, they are assigned to some form of table or workspace within which they can keep their tools and belongings and work on the robot. Once the pits are set up, robot inspections begin and robots are certified for the competition. A hardware inspection ensures that the robot starts within an 18"x18"x18" cube and poses no danger to drive teams, referees, or the audience. Once the hardware has been deemed safe and legal, the robot undergoes a software inspection. The software is tested to ensure that the robot is operational and safe. Once certified, the robot is allowed to compete in matches.</p>
