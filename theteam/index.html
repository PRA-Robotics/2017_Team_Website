                <p class='sectionTextA'>We are a group of 13 or so pseudo-engineers who love robotics and everything related to it. Some of us love programming the robot, others building it. Everyone has a job to do on our team, and we've gotten so good at pretending like we know what we're doing, sometimes we actually do. All joking aside though, our team is just beginning to blossom into a veteran team as we begin to learn from the rookie mistakes we've made over the last three years and build a legacy of tips a tricks to pass on to new members or other rookie teams.</p>

                    <p class='sectionHeaderB'>Entering Our Prime</p>
                    <p class='sectionTextB'>We began as a four-man team with a Tetrix starter kit and a couple of allen wrenches. We had no idea what was expected of us and we did our best to build a robot capable of scoring points. We've since learned the importance of the engineering notebook, how to divide and conquer the work load, and what contitutes a decent robot. We've discovered the simple combinations of parts that can be put together into complex, reliable modules, allowing us to do well in competitions. Finally, as we come to learn what Gracious Professionalism really means, we are prepared to enter a new era for our team, and discover how to be a major competitor in the <i>FIRST</i><sup>Â®</sup> Tech Challenge.</p>

                <p class='sectionHeaderA'>Team Organization</p>
                <p class='sectionTextA'>Most of the jobs in our team can be organized into one of three catagories: Hardware, Software, and Organization. Tasks that fall under the hardware category include chassis and module construction, wiring, and design. Tasks that fall under the software category include module, controller, and autonomous programming. Finally, tasks that fall under the organization category include overall Engineering Notebook organization, 3D Modeling and Printing, and community outreach. Although there are generally no assignments or locked-in positions, most of us tend to find a niche we enjoy and stick to it for the season. For the most part, this has been an effective way of organizing (and explaining) how our team operates.</p>
