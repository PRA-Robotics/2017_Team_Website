                <p id='hardwaredbody'>The Hardware Dept is responsible for actually building the robot itself. This includes the drive system or chassis, the modules required for gameplay, and how to fit it all together. This often requires prototyping and restarting several times before the robot can be functional. The Hardware Dept interacts with the Software Dept most often but sometimes calls upon the Organization Dept to print the occasional adapter or mount. Working in the Hardware Dept is a rollercoaster of emotion throughout the year as we fall into slumps and climb out of them repeatedly. That said, the most rewarding moment comes when the constant aggravation of prototyping over and over again pays off and the robot successfully completes its objective.</p>

                <p>Although this page seems empty, it will eventually be filled with helpful videos to explain our robot and how we completed it. This will likely not be a thing until after the robot for the 2017-2018 season is built.</p>
